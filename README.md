This project contains an interpreter for RPG, which runs on the JVM. The interpreter is written in Kotlin.

## How to compile the code

The project uses gradle and a gradle wrapper is included. That means that you can simply execute `./gradlew` (on Mac/Linux) or `gradlew.bat` (on Windows) to run it.

The project contains an ANTLR grammar from which a parser in Java is generated. To generate it run:

```
./gradlew generateGrammarSource
```

The code can then be compiled with:

```
./gradlew build
```

IDEA project files can be generated by running:

```
./gradlew idea
```

## Running tests

All tests can be executed by running:

```
./gradlew check
```

## How the repository is organized

* _generated-src_ contains the code generated from the grammar
* _gradle_, _gradlew_, and _gradlew.bat_ contain the gradle wrapper
* _src_ contains the source code for the project and the tests
* _out_, and _build_ contain temporary files

## Credits

The grammar used in this project is based on the work from Ryan Eberly. It is derived from his project [rpgleparser](https://github.com/rpgleparser/rpgleparser).
